# Cursor Rules for YouTube VJ React Project

## Automatic Code Change Response

### 0. Automatic Commit Message Generation
- **ALWAYS generate commit messages after code changes are completed**
- **Generate commit messages for EVERY set of changes made during development**
- Do not wait for user request - proactively provide commit messages
- This ensures proper documentation of all development progress
- Commit message generation is MANDATORY for all code modifications

## Commit Message Rules

### 1. Use Conventional Commits Format
All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### 2. Commit Messages Must Be in English
- All commit messages, including type, description, body, and footer must be written in English
- Use clear, concise, and descriptive language

### 3. Commit Types
Use the following commit types:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### 4. Breaking Changes
- Use `!` after the type/scope for breaking changes: `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:`
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer for detailed explanation

### 5. Commit Message Generation Process
When code changes are made, follow this process:

#### MANDATORY: Check Diff Before Commit Message Generation
1. **Always run `git status` and `git diff` (or `git diff --cached` for staged changes)**
2. **Analyze the COMPLETE diff from the last commit, not just current conversation changes**
3. **Generate commit message based on the actual file changes, not conversation context**
4. **Commit message generation must be the FINAL step after all code changes are complete**

#### Important Notes:
- ❌ **DO NOT** base commit messages on single conversation changes
- ✅ **DO** base commit messages on the cumulative diff from the last commit
- ❌ **DO NOT** generate commit messages in the middle of development
- ✅ **DO** generate commit messages only when ready to commit
- ✅ **DO** generate commit messages automatically after each set of changes
- ✅ **DO** provide commit messages proactively without waiting for user request
- The commit message must reflect ALL changes since the last commit, even if they span multiple conversations

#### Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Review all changes from last commit
git diff HEAD

# 3. Stage changes if needed
git add .

# 4. Review staged changes
git diff --cached

# 5. Generate commit message based on COMPLETE diff
# 6. Commit with proper Conventional Commits format
```

#### Terminal Command Troubleshooting
When terminal commands fail (`Exit code: 1` with no output), follow these steps:

1. **Immediate Retry Strategy:**
   ```bash
   # If simple commands fail, try with explicit directory change
   cd /home/kazuki/dev/youtube-vj-react && git status
   cd /home/kazuki/dev/youtube-vj-react && git diff HEAD
   ```

2. **Session Recovery:**
   - If sequential commands fail, start a new terminal session
   - Always include `cd` to ensure proper working directory
   - Use `&&` to chain directory change with the intended command

3. **Reliable Command Patterns:**
   ```bash
   # Preferred pattern for critical commands
   cd /home/kazuki/dev/youtube-vj-react && git diff HEAD
   cd /home/kazuki/dev/youtube-vj-react && git status
   cd /home/kazuki/dev/youtube-vj-react && git add .
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting Order:**
   1. Try the command as-is first
   2. If it fails, try with `cd && command` pattern
   3. If still failing, check directory permissions and git repository status
   4. Use `pwd` and `ls -la` to verify environment

5. **Best Practices:**
   - Always verify successful command execution before proceeding
   - When in doubt, use the `cd && command` pattern for reliability
   - Don't assume terminal state persists between operations

### 6. Examples

#### Good Examples:
```
feat: add real-time YouTube player status display

- implement useState-based state management
- add volume and playback rate sliders
- display current time and duration

feat!: update YouTubePlayer interface

BREAKING CHANGE: PlayerStatus.state renamed to playerState

refactor: consolidate useEffect hooks for better performance

fix: resolve infinite loop in status updates

docs: update README with installation instructions

chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

#### Bad Examples:
```
❌ update player        (not descriptive, no type)
❌ 機能追加             (not in English)
❌ feat player update   (missing colon after type)
❌ FIX: broken stuff    (type should be lowercase)
❌ fix: handle onChange event (based on single conversation, ignoring other changes)
```

## Code Quality Rules

### 1. TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Define proper interfaces for props and state
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary

### 2. React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance optimization
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility

### 3. Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write concise but readable code
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Use consistent formatting (handled by Biome)

### 4. Performance
- Minimize re-renders by optimizing dependencies
- Use `useCallback` for event handlers passed as props
- Consolidate related state updates when possible

## VJ Application Specific Rules

### 1. MIDI Integration
- All MIDI-related functionality should be secure and sandboxed
- Use iframe with sandbox attributes for user script execution
- Validate MIDI input before processing

### 2. YouTube Player
- Maintain real-time state synchronization between player and UI
- Handle YouTube API events properly
- Ensure smooth playback control without interruptions

### 3. State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Keep component-level state minimal and focused
- Persist important settings to localStorage

## File Organization

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── features/           # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── stores/             # Zustand stores
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/              # Utility functions
```

## Before Committing

1. ✅ Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved
2. ✅ Run linter and fix any issues
3. ✅ Test the functionality manually
4. ✅ **MANDATORY: Run `git diff` to review ALL changes from last commit**
5. ✅ **Use terminal troubleshooting steps if commands fail**
6. ✅ **Generate commit message based on complete diff, not conversation context**
7. ✅ Write a proper Conventional Commit message in English
8. ✅ Review the diff to ensure only intended changes are included
9. ✅ **AUTOMATICALLY provide commit message after code changes**

## Development Workflow

### After Each Code Change Session:
1. **Review all changes made**: `git diff HEAD` (use troubleshooting steps if needed)
2. **Stage changes**: `git add .`
3. **Generate commit message**: Based on complete diff analysis
4. **Provide ready-to-use commit command**: With proper Conventional Commits format
5. **Document what was changed**: Clear explanation in Japanese for user understanding

### Terminal Session Management:
- Monitor command success/failure status
- Be prepared to start new sessions with `cd` commands
- Use reliable command patterns for critical operations
- Verify working directory before important git operations

This ensures continuous documentation, proper version control, and reliable terminal operations throughout development.
